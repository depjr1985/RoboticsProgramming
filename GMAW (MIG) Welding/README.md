## Application Creation

For our MIG Welding Application I used the Tablet Teach Pendant that utilizes click-and-drag icons on a tablet interface.

FANUC's icon-based programming interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, especially for beginners or training environments. It features a touch-friendly layout optimized for tablet-style teach pendants, allowing users to program robots using simple drag-and-drop commands. With no coding required, it provides a visual approach to robot programming that makes it easy to create and understand motion sequences and logic without needing prior programming experience.

We can also export our LS file from the Tablet Teach Pendant for viewing and editing as well, which I have attached to this project for reference.
