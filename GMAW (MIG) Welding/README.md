## Application Creation

For our MIG Welding Application I used the Tablet Teach Pendant that utilizes click-and-drag icons on a tablet interface.

FANUC's icon-based programming interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, especially for beginners or training environments. It features a touch-friendly layout optimized for tablet-style teach pendants, allowing users to program robots using simple drag-and-drop commands. With no coding required, it provides a visual approach to robot programming that makes it easy to create and understand motion sequences and logic without needing prior programming experience.

We can also export our LS file from the Tablet Teach Pendant for viewing and editing as well, which I have attached to this project for reference.

## Welding and Welding Schedules

### Weld One

Our first weld uses PROCEDURE 1, SCHEDULE 2. The animations in the images shows the direction of our Welds

### Weld Two

Weld 2 used PROCEDURE 1, SCHEDULE 2. During this weld we kepts the welding torch as horizontal as possible until the fixture locks required us to tilt the torch.

### Weld Three

Weld 3 used PROCEDURE 1, SCHEDULE 1. Welding with a circular motion instruction managed to get us a very nice weld while some used many smaller liniar motions for the downward curve for theirs.
