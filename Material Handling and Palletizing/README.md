# Material Handling and Palletizing

## General Concept Map

By using a concept map, we can more easily understand the relationships between different ideas, concepts, and information, providing a structured visual overview that enhances organization. We can use it to simplify complex data, showing how each element connects which can aid us in planning and decision-making. It allows us to see the big picture of what we aim to accomplish within our program.
